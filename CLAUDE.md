# CLAUDE.md

This is the working contract for building the Higgsfield AI frontend take-home. Re-read it at the start of each session. If a suggestion you're about to make contradicts something here, stop and flag it — don't quietly drift.

## 1. Project mission

A React + TypeScript media feed for Higgsfield AI: justified-row layout of mixed images and videos, virtualized to handle ~2k items smoothly, with a user-adjustable column count that preserves scroll position. Evaluators (frontend engineers at a media-heavy AI company) will read the README and the code, and will ask the candidate about any line in a live walkthrough. "Good" means: smooth at 2k items on a mid-tier laptop, every tradeoff is intentional and defensible, and the code is boring enough to explain cold.

Time budget: **10–15 hours total**. Feature count is not the grading axis — reasoning about tradeoffs is. We pick ONE stretch goal deliberately, late, for the Loom.

## 2. Non-goals — refuse or push back if asked

- State management libraries (Redux, Zustand, Jotai, Recoil). `useState` + `useReducer` cover this app.
- UI component libraries (shadcn, MUI, Chakra, Radix, Headless UI). Plain CSS only.
- Tailwind (or any utility-CSS framework). Whole UI lives in ~25 distinct CSS properties; the value of utility classes (scaling across a large surface) doesn't activate at this scope. Plain CSS in `src/styles/index.css`.
- Testing infrastructure beyond *at most* one or two pure-function unit tests for the layout algorithm. No Vitest config sprawl, no React Testing Library, no Playwright.
- Authentication, routing, SSR, server components, API layers. The dataset is a static JSON file.
- FSD, feature-folder, hexagonal, clean architecture, or any other generic structure. The pragmatic split below is deliberate for a ~25-file project.
- Premature abstractions: "pluggable layout strategy", "feed framework", generic media adapters, render-prop kitchen sinks. We have one feed, one layout, two media types.
- Empty folders, barrel/index re-export files, placeholder modules "for future use".
- Pixel-perfect styling, design polish, animations beyond the chosen stretch goal.
- Cross-browser support beyond modern Chrome + Safari. No IE, no legacy Firefox, no polyfills.
- `npm install`-ing new packages without explicit approval.

## 3. Architecture

```

The split is along the axis that matters at this scale: **pure logic / React-coupled logic / rendering**. Same separation FSD or hexagonal enforce, without the ceremony.

### Rules — enforce ruthlessly

1. **`lib/` imports nothing from `hooks/`, `components/`, or React.** If you want to, the abstraction is wrong — move the React part into a hook that calls the pure function.
2. **`components/` consume hooks; they don't reimplement logic.** Component too long? Extract a hook, don't split the component.
3. **Import direction is one-way: `lib/` ← `hooks/` ← `components/`.** Never the reverse.
4. **One concern per file. Don't pre-split.** Split `MediaItem.tsx` into `VideoPlayer.tsx` only when the file actually gets unwieldy.
5. **Name by problem, not pattern.** `useJustifiedLayout` ✓. `useFeedLogic`, `useFeature`, `useHelpers` ✗.
6. **Don't pre-create.** If we never write the velocity hook, the file doesn't exist. No empty scaffolding.

### When to deviate

If one concept genuinely grows into 4–5 cohesive files (e.g., the video playback subsystem), promote it to `hooks/videoPlayback/` with an `index.ts`. Only when the flat layout actually hurts — not preemptively.

## 4. Code quality bar

**TypeScript**

- Types express intent. No `any`. No `as` assertions without a one-line comment justifying them.
- `type` for data shapes, discriminated unions, function signatures. `interface` for component props is fine.
- `MediaItem = Image | Video` with a discriminant field. Use type guards in `lib/mediaItem.ts`, not inline `'kind' in x` checks.

**React**

- Function components, hooks. No class components, no HOCs.
- `useMemo` / `useCallback` only where there's a measurable reason. Don't blanket-wrap. The justified-layout computation **is** one of those places; a button's onClick is not.
- `useLayoutEffect` only where the DOM read/write must happen before paint (scroll anchoring). Otherwise `useEffect`.
- We are CSR-only (no SSR, no server components per section 2). `useLayoutEffect` is used as-is; do not wrap it in `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` or any equivalent SSR-safety helper. If you see warnings about it during build, that's a misconfiguration, not a reason to add a wrapper.
- Keys: stable item IDs from the dataset. Never array index for the feed items.

**Comments**

- Explain *why*, not *what*. Well-named identifiers handle the *what*.
- Annotate every non-obvious tradeoff: layout algorithm choice, anchor strategy, video concurrency cap, virtualizer overscan value, any magic number.
- No "added for X" or "used by Y" comments — they rot.

**Performance**

- Measure before optimizing past the obvious. Layout math is memoized. Row components are stable. That's the floor.
- If you reach for `React.memo`, justify it (referential stability of inputs is required, otherwise it's noise).

**Styling**

- Plain CSS in `src/styles/index.css`. Class names describe what an element IS, not how it looks — `.feed`, `.row`, `.item`, `.control`. Never `.flex-wrap-center` or `.mt-4`.
- Computed values (positions, sizes coming from the layout output) go in inline `style={}`. Everything else goes in CSS.
- No CSS-in-JS, no Tailwind, no UI libraries. If you'd reach for one, write the ~5 lines of CSS instead.

## 5. The five core pillars — pinned decisions

These are load-bearing. Don't drift mid-build.

### 1. Justified-row layout algorithm

- **Home:** `lib/justifiedLayout.ts` (pure) + `hooks/useJustifiedLayout.ts` (React wrapper with memoization)
- **Chose:** greedy with target row height (Flickr-style). Walk items, accumulate until aspect-ratio sum exceeds container/target, scale the row to fit.
- **Rejected:** global DP (Knuth-Plass). Optimal line-breaking is irrelevant when (a) we virtualize and only see ~20 rows, and (b) data may eventually be progressive. Greedy composes with both.
- **Column-count control** adjusts the *target row height*, not a strict column count. Justified layout is intrinsically fuzzy on counts — pretending otherwise lies to the user.
- **User-facing label vs. internal model:** the UI control is labeled "columns" and exposes an integer count to the user. Internally, this is translated to a target row height via `targetRowHeight = (containerWidth - (columns - 1) * gap) / columns`, which is then passed to the layout algorithm. The actual number of items per row will vary based on aspect ratios — that's the honest behavior of justified layout. Do not attempt to enforce a strict per-row item count.

### 2. Virtualization

- **Home:** `components/MediaFeed.tsx`, using `@tanstack/react-virtual`.
- **Chose:** headless virtualizer, we own the row layout math.
- **Rejected:** `react-window` (fights variable-height rows that depend on our own layout output), hand-rolled (reinvents scroll edge cases for no payoff).
- **Integration pattern:** row heights are *derivable* from the layout algorithm output, not *measurable* from rendered DOM. We pass exact heights to the virtualizer via `estimateSize` (returning the precomputed value for each row index). We do NOT use the virtualizer's dynamic measurement API (`measureElement` or equivalent). Dynamic measurement causes a one-frame layout shift on every newly-revealed row, which is exactly the jank we're trying to avoid. If a library example shows the dynamic pattern, that's a default for cases where heights aren't known ahead of time — it doesn't apply to us.

### 3. Scroll anchoring

- **Home:** `hooks/useScrollAnchor.ts`
- **Chose:** anchor on the topmost fully-visible item. If no item is fully visible (mid-scroll, item straddles the viewport top), fall back to the topmost partially-visible item and record its negative offset — i.e., how many pixels of that item are *above* the viewport's top edge. Capture {itemId, offsetFromViewportTop} before re-layout; in `useLayoutEffect`, find the item's new row position and set `scrollTop = newRowY - offsetFromViewportTop` before paint. Anchor by item identity (id), never by index, so the same hook also handles live-prepended items (stretch S6) without modification.
- **Rejected:** center-of-viewport anchor (more code, identical felt result), CSS `overflow-anchor` (insufficient control across virtualized re-layouts).

### 4. Media loading strategy

- **Home:** `components/MediaItem.tsx` (cell), `components/VideoPlayer.tsx` (video, when needed), `hooks/useVideoPlayback.ts` (concurrency manager)
- **Chose:** native `loading="lazy"` for images, IntersectionObserver overscan for both, video posters by default, autoplay only when stationary in viewport, **cap ~3 concurrent playing videos**, prefer items nearest viewport center.
- **Rejected:** aggressive prefetch (bandwidth waste, especially on cellular), play-all-videos-in-view (CPU + decode pressure on mid-tier laptops).

### 5. Resize handling

- **Home:** `hooks/useContainerWidth.ts`
- **Chose:** `ResizeObserver` on the container element, throttle the state update to `requestAnimationFrame`.
- **Rejected:** debounced `window.resize` (visible lag, doesn't catch container-only changes like sidebar toggles).

## 6. README orientation

The README is graded heavily. Whenever we make a non-trivial tradeoff during the build, **ask in chat: "should we note this for the README?"** Don't write the README incrementally inside CLAUDE.md — the Decisions log below feeds it at the end.

README skeleton (build at the very end):

1. What it is + how to run it
2. Architecture at a glance (the pure/hooks/components split)
3. The five pillars, one paragraph each — chose / rejected / why
4. The chosen stretch goal + why that one
5. What I would do with another 10 hours

## 7. Walkthrough preparedness

The candidate will be asked about *any line* of code live.

- **No code I can't explain.** If you suggest a clever pattern, explain it inline in a comment OR walk me through it in chat first.
- **Prefer boring, readable solutions** over clever ones unless the clever one has a clear, statable payoff.
- **If you reach for a library, justify it in chat** — why it beats the hand-rolled version *for this specific use*.
- If I sound uncertain about something we wrote, that's a flag to pause and walk through it — don't keep building on top of confusion.

## 8. Workflow conventions

- **Commits:** Conventional Commits — `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`.
- **Branching:** single `main` branch, no PR ceremony.
- **Significant architectural changes:** suggest a commit point.
- **New packages:** ask before `npm install`. State what it gives us, what the alternative is, and what it costs in bundle size if relevant.
- **Dev server:** Vite. Don't restart it unless config changes; HMR is fine.
- **No scratch artifacts in commits:** no commented-out code, no `console.log`s, no `debugger` statements in committed files. Use `git stash` for temporary experiments. `// TODO` comments are allowed only when they reference something explicitly out of scope (e.g., a stretch goal we deliberately skipped), with a one-line justification on the same line. Exception: one-off scripts under `scripts/` (dataset generator, layout test harness) may use `console.log` for summaries and progress — they're tooling, not app code, and the output is the script's user-facing surface.
- **Dead code:** if a hook, util, or type is no longer imported anywhere, delete it the same commit. Don't leave it "in case." Section 2's "no scaffolding for future use" applies retroactively to abandoned code too.

## 9. Decisions log

Append entries here as we go. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD — decision — alternatives considered — why`. These feed directly into the README.

---

- **2026-05-23 — Pragmatic modular structure (pure/hooks/components).** Alternatives: FSD, feature-folder, hexagonal. Why: speculative generality for a ~25-file project; the three-axis split gives the same enforceable boundaries without the ceremony. See §3.
- **2026-05-23 — Vite + Tailwind + @tanstack/react-virtual + local React state.** Alternatives: CRA/Next; CSS Modules/styled-components; react-window/hand-rolled virtualizer; Redux/Zustand/Jotai. Why: minimal stack that fits the time budget and the CSR-only scope. See §2, §5 pillar 2.
- **2026-05-23 — Greedy justified layout with target row height.** Alternative: global DP (Knuth-Plass). Why: composes with virtualization and progressive data; optimality is irrelevant when only ~20 rows are visible. See §5 pillar 1.
- **2026-05-23 — Column-count control maps to target row height, not strict per-row count.** Alternative: enforce N items per row. Why: justified layout is intrinsically fuzzy on counts; enforcing it would lie to the user. See §5 pillar 1.
- **2026-05-23 — Scroll anchor by item identity, captured pre-layout, restored in `useLayoutEffect`.** Alternatives: center-of-viewport anchor, CSS `overflow-anchor`, index-based anchoring. Why: id-based handles re-layout and live-prepend (S6) with one mechanism; layout-effect runs before paint so the user sees no jump. See §5 pillar 3.
- **2026-05-23 — Precomputed row heights passed to virtualizer via `estimateSize`; no dynamic measurement.** Alternative: `measureElement`. Why: heights are derivable from layout output, so dynamic measurement only buys us a per-row layout-shift frame. See §5 pillar 2.
- **2026-05-23 — Video: poster-by-default, autoplay-when-stationary, ~3 concurrent cap, prefer viewport-center.** Alternatives: aggressive prefetch, play-all-in-view. Why: bandwidth and decode pressure on mid-tier laptops. See §5 pillar 4.
- **2026-05-23 — `ResizeObserver` + rAF-throttled width state.** Alternatives: debounced `window.resize`. Why: catches container-only changes (e.g., sidebar toggles) and avoids visible debounce lag. See §5 pillar 5. *(Superseded 2026-05-23 — see entry below.)*
- **2026-05-23 — `ResizeObserver` + `flushSync`, not rAF-throttled.** Alternative: rAF-throttle the width setState (the prior decision). Why: rAF-throttling introduced a one-frame lag during sustained resize drags. ResizeObserver fires after layout but before paint; React's default scheduler can defer a plain setState from a non-event callback to a later task, so the next paint shows the new viewport width with the previous frame's cell positions — cells laid out wider than the new viewport spill past the right edge as a visible white band. `flushSync` forces the re-render to commit inside the observer callback, before paint, eliminating the lag. The 2k-item layout cost (~ms) is well inside one frame, so the synchronous render is acceptable. *(Superseded 2026-05-23 — see entry below.)*
- **2026-05-23 — `useContainerWidth` uses `useSyncExternalStore`, not `setState` + `flushSync`.** Alternative: setState (rAF-throttled, plain, or flushSync-wrapped — all tried in turn). Why: rAF-throttled = one-frame lag during drag (white band on the right). Plain setState = same lag because React's scheduler defers updates from non-event callbacks. flushSync inside the observer = same-frame width, but produces "flushSync was called from inside a lifecycle method" warnings whenever a layout change cascades (e.g., scrollbar toggle on slider drag) and re-fires the observer mid-commit. `useSyncExternalStore` is the React-blessed primitive for this exact case: the observer is the change signal, `getSnapshot` reads `getBoundingClientRect().width` fresh on every render, and React handles consistency without flushSync or scheduler entanglement.
- **2026-05-23 — `useScrollAnchor` dispatches a synthetic `scroll` event after setting `scrollTop`, and `useVirtualizer` is configured with `useFlushSync: false`.** Alternative: rely on the browser's async scroll event delivery (the original approach). Why: when anchor restoration sets `scrollTop` in `useLayoutEffect`, the browser delivers the scroll event on a later task. Meanwhile the virtualizer's already-committed render used its cached `scrollOffset` (stale, from before restoration), so the rows in the DOM are positioned for the *previous* scrollTop in the *new* layout's coordinate space — viewport at the restored scrollTop renders empty. Synchronously dispatching the scroll event lands the virtualizer's offset update inside the same commit cycle so the next paint is correct. The virtualizer's default `useFlushSync: true` would then fire a dev-mode warning (flushSync inside a lifecycle), and `useFlushSync: false` is documented in the library as exactly the override for this case — under React 18 the plain rerender still commits before paint when triggered from inside an effect.
- **2026-05-23 — `getItemKey` is reconstructed via `useCallback` with `[layout]` deps so the virtualizer's measurements cache invalidates on layout change.** Alternative: trust the virtualizer to re-measure when `estimateSize` returns new values (it doesn't). Why: `@tanstack/virtual-core`'s `getMeasurementOptions` memo deps include `count, paddingStart, scrollMargin, getItemKey, enabled, lanes, laneAssignmentMode` — but not `estimateSize`. Re-creating `estimateSize` on every render with a fresh closure does not invalidate the memo, so the per-row sizes/positions stay cached from the previous layout. Symptom: after widening the viewport, `virtualizer.getTotalSize()` returns the previous layout's total — rows positioned by the current layout extend past the scroll surface, and the viewport at max scrollTop renders empty (the "scroll heavily down → white" report). Re-creating `getItemKey` (which *is* in the memo deps) on every layout change forces a same-render rebuild without affecting the actual key values (still the row index).
- **2026-05-23 — `useScrollAnchor`'s capture prefers the previously-captured anchor item if it's still within the current topmost row's `[startIndex, endIndex)`.** Alternative: always pick the row's leftmost item (the original rule). Why: every layout change re-captures the anchor after restoration. If the new layout is denser (e.g., 8 cols when the prior capture was at 5 cols), the row containing the anchor item now has more items per row, and its *leftmost* is some earlier item in the dataset. Without preservation, rapid slider toggles between extreme column counts walk the anchor backward, ~1 row of visual drift per 3–4 toggles. Preferring the prior anchor when it's still in the row keeps the identity stable across toggles — a 1↔8 round-trip leaves scrollTop within ~3px of where it started (verified). The "otherwise default to leftmost" branch is unchanged for the common case (user scrolled to a new row).
- **2026-05-23 — MediaItems are rendered as a flat list under `.feed-inner`, keyed by `item.id`. Rows are a layout concept, not a DOM concept (no `.row` wrapper).** Alternative: keep `MediaRow` as a wrapper, key items by `item.id` within their row. Why: when columns change, an item that was in row N at cols=5 may end up in row M at cols=8. With a row wrapper, React reconciles items WITHIN their row's children list — an item moving rows means the destination row's children list gets a new key, mounting a new `MediaItem` and a fresh `<img>` element even though the resource is cached. Result: visible dark-placeholder flash on most cells during a slider drag. Flattening lifts keying to the top level so the same `<img>` DOM node survives a layout reshuffle as long as the item stays in the visible set. Verified: 53–100% of items keep their DOM nodes across column-count changes (the variance is just newly-visible items entering the larger viewport at higher column counts — those legitimately need to mount). Tradeoff: small loss of structural clarity in the DOM tree (rows no longer visible as DOM groups). Won because the brief grades smooth reflow at 2k items, and the algorithm's row concept is still fully visible in `LayoutRow`/`useJustifiedLayout` — only the DOM grouping went away.
- **2026-05-23 — Dropped `loading="lazy"` from image cells.** Alternative: keep it as defense-in-depth. Why: virtualization is the load-bearing gate for which items exist in the DOM — every mounted `<img>` is near or inside the viewport. The browser's lazy-loading on top adds a ~1-frame intersection-check delay before paint with zero benefit. Tradeoffs: (1) MediaItem is now slightly more eager — anyone mounting it outside a virtualizer (we don't, but could) will see immediate fetches; (2) the safety net for a hypothetical high-overscan future change is gone; (3) this does NOT fix the perceptual flash on remount during rapid extreme column toggles — that's decoded-pixel release on unmount, which would require an off-DOM image cache (S3 territory) to address. We accept the flash as the honest cost of bounded DOM at 2k items.
- **2026-05-23 — One stretch goal, chosen late.** Alternative: attempt several. Why: time budget and grading axis (tradeoff reasoning over feature count); S1 is the leading candidate for Loom impact. See §1.
- **2026-05-23 — Tailwind v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (no PostCSS, no `tailwind.config.js`).** Alternatives: v4 + PostCSS (slower, no benefit here); Tailwind v3 (more docs, more config). Why: official v4 default, fastest build, CSS-first config means one line in `index.css` and zero config files.
- **2026-05-23 — `@/*` path alias to `src/*`.** Alternative: relative imports only. Why: keeps deep imports readable (`@/lib/justifiedLayout` over `../../lib/justifiedLayout`); explicit in tsconfig + Vite resolve, so the wiring is visible to a reviewer.
- **2026-05-23 — Removed Tailwind; plain CSS instead (supersedes the earlier Tailwind decision).** Alternatives: keep Tailwind v4, CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS. Why: whole UI is ~25 CSS properties — utility classes don't earn their place at this surface area. Inlined Andy Bell's reset in `src/styles/index.css`; component styles named by what the element IS (`.feed`, `.row`, `.item`). Computed values (positions, sizes from layout output) stay in inline `style={}`. See §4 styling subsection.
- **2026-05-23 — `MediaItem` carries only `aspectRatio`, not `width`/`height`.** Alternative: store nominal `width`/`height` in the dataset alongside `aspectRatio`. Why: the only width that matters is `aspectRatio * rowHeight` at render time. A nominal width baked into the JSON is decorative and would never be the right number to request — keeping it in the type would imply it was load-bearing.
- **2026-05-23 — Dataset sources: Picsum (`/seed/{seed}/{w}/{h}`) for images and video posters; gtv-videos-bucket sample MP4s reused across video items.** Alternatives: Unsplash (API key + rate limits), Pexels (same), self-host (out of scope), unique video per item (no public source provides this). Why: both sources are public, zero-auth, and stable. Picsum's seeded endpoint means the same item id always resolves to the same image, so re-runs and reloads don't churn the visual. The 13 gtv sample MP4s repeat — the brief grades playback behavior, not asset variety, so this is honest. *(Superseded 2026-05-23 — gtv-videos-bucket lost anonymous access; see entry below.)*
- **2026-05-23 — Video URLs moved from `commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/*.mp4` to `test-videos.co.uk/vids/{name}/mp4/h264/360/*.mp4`.** Alternative: keep gtv-videos-bucket. Why: Google revoked anonymous read access to the gtv bucket — every fetch returned 403 (`AccessDenied / storage.objects.get denied`), so video tags showed posters indefinitely and the playback manager's `play()` calls all rejected silently. test-videos.co.uk hosts the same Big Buck Bunny / Sintel / Jellyfish Creative-Commons sources with stable URLs and `accept-ranges: bytes` for streaming. 9 distinct URLs (3 clips × 3 size variants) instead of 13 — fewer unique files but the brief grades playback *behavior*, not asset variety, so still honest. Picsum for images/posters is unchanged. *(Superseded 2026-05-23 — see entry below; the size-variant URLs added no visual variety so they were dropped.)*
- **2026-05-23 — Video items use 3 base clip URLs combined with 10 `#t=N` Media Fragment hashes to produce 30 visually-distinct variants, round-robin-assigned to the 400 video items.** Alternative: stick with the 9 base URLs and accept 44× duplication per file; or reduce video count to ~30 and accept 1.5% video density (too sparse to demo the playback manager). Why: public CC-licensed sample MP4s come from only 3 visual subjects (Big Buck Bunny, Sintel, Jellyfish) — every "sample-video CDN" hosts the same shorts. The `#t=N` hash makes each `<video>` element seek to a different second of the underlying clip on first play, so a viewport rarely shows the same moment of the same clip twice. The MP4 is fetched and cached once per base URL (the hash is client-side only). Round-robin assignment via a per-video cursor (incremented only on video items, not on every item) spreads the 30 variants evenly across 400 video items, so adjacent video items always get different variants. Honest scope limit: with only 3 visual subjects, fully unique videos across 400 items is impossible without auth APIs or self-hosting; we maximize *perceived* variety within that constraint. Verified empirically: 10 mounted videos in the initial viewport use 10 distinct URLs; the 3 concurrently-playing videos have 3 distinct URLs; each video's `currentTime` reflects its assigned `#t` offset on first play.
- **2026-05-23 — Aspect-ratio distribution: 50% landscape (1.2–2.0), 30% portrait (0.5–0.9), 15% square-ish (0.9–1.2), 2.5% panorama (2.5–3.5), 2.5% tall portrait (0.3–0.5).** Alternative: uniform distribution, or skip the extremes. Why: the 5% extreme bucket exists *because* panoramas and tall portraits are the inputs that break naive greedy layout — we want them in the test set, not absent from it.
- **2026-05-23 — Deterministic generator (Mulberry32 PRNG, fixed seed `0xc0ffee`).** Alternative: `Math.random()`. Why: `items.json` is checked into git; with a fixed seed, regenerating only produces a diff if the *logic* changed (kinds, distribution, URLs). With `Math.random`, every regen would churn 2000 lines for no semantic reason. ~5 lines of arithmetic for diff-stability is a good trade.
- **2026-05-23 — `estimateSize` returns `row.height + (isLast ? 0 : gap)`, not `row.height + gap` unconditionally.** Alternative: unconditional `+ gap`. Why: prevents a trailing-gap dead zone at the bottom of the scroll surface. Per-row start positions are equal between both versions (by construction); only the total height differed.
- **2026-05-23 — Columns→targetRowHeight translation lives in MediaFeed, not App.** Alternative: lift containerWidth to App via a tuple-returning useContainerWidth, or compute in App from a separately-measured width. Why: containerWidth is owned by MediaFeed (via useContainerWidth on scrollRef); lifting the measurement up would either duplicate the observer or split scrollRef from its measured element. The translation is a layout-subsystem implementation detail, and keeping it next to useJustifiedLayout means the full conversion chain is visible in one file.
- **2026-05-23 — Anchor row selection: topmost row with y >= scrollTop.** Alternatives considered: (a) first row whose y range intersects scrollTop (anchored item slips above viewport when cells shrink); (b) original three-branch "topmost fully-visible / next / straddling" rule (requires viewport height, more code paths). Why: the chosen rule preserves anchor durability under cell shrinkage (the row's top edge stays at-or-below scrollTop, so the row moves within the viewport rather than out of it) without requiring viewport height. Verified across cols 5→3, 5→7, 5→2, 5→8, and viewport 1400→900 — all transitions preserve the topmost-visible item id within ±2 indices and the anchor item's screen position within sub-pixel drift.
- **2026-05-23 — Scroll anchor verified by anchor-item presence + sub-pixel position drift, not by "topmost-leftmost item index stability".** Alternative: the topmost-leftmost-item ±N metric. Why: in justified-row layout, the row-boundary indices shift by up to (max_columns - 1) when column count changes, even when the anchor item's screen position is preserved sub-pixel. The leftmost-item metric measures row-boundary stability, which is incidental to the user-perceived "I'm looking at the same thing" property the brief grades. Anchor-item presence + position drift is the precise correctness statement: across cols 5→3, 5→7, 5→2, 5→8 and viewport 1400→900, the captured item stays in viewport with ≤2px screen-position drift in all cases (measured: 0.01–0.5px).
- **2026-05-23 — Video cells render `<video poster={posterUrl} src={url} preload="none" muted playsInline loop>`, controlled play/pause from useVideoPlayback (no autoplay attribute).** Alternative: an `<img>` overlay above the `<video>`, shown when paused, hidden when playing. Why: native poster is one DOM node and matches the browser's own poster timing for free. The one behavioral cost — a paused-after-play video shows its last frame rather than the poster — is acceptable for this surface. The overlay version would require synchronizing two elements' visibility with play/pause events, adding state we don't need.
- **2026-05-23 — Videos use `preload="none"`, not `preload="metadata"`.** Alternative: `preload="metadata"` (browser-default for unconstrained feeds). Why: for our manager-controlled playback, `play()` starts downloading from byte 0 anyway; metadata pre-fetch is wasted. `preload="none"` means only the poster image is downloaded for any video the user doesn't choose to play, saving bandwidth across the 400 video items in the dataset.
- **2026-05-23 — useVideoPlayback lives at `hooks/useVideoPlayback.tsx` (.tsx, not .ts), bundling the provider and hook together.** Alternative: split provider to `components/VideoPlaybackProvider.tsx` and hook to `hooks/useVideoPlayback.ts`. Why: the provider and hook are tightly co-designed through their shared context; splitting them across two files would force an export/import dance for the context itself and obscure the lifecycle (mount provider → observer + scroll listener; mount hook → register element). One file reads as one subsystem.
